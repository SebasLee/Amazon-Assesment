# Github and Repositories

Github is a code-hosting platform that can track and save code in real time. It connects to a user's code editor and allows open-source access to that user's repository (the space where code is stored). In other words, Github allows for collaboration between different users on the same projects. 

One popular method Github users use to collaborate on repositories is called **Forking**. Forking is when users take a copy of a repositry and clone it into their local computers to make edits. This method is in contrast to direct **Cloning**, which forgoes forking and only clones down the original repository.

Cloning the original repository can quickly update projects since invited users can push changes at anytime. In group projects however, this can lead to unwanted changes in the main code if users are not communicating effectively. Therefore this process is suited better for groups that decentralize their assignments. 

Forking repositories allows for wider access to github users since they can edit any public project with supervision. Merging edits with the original repository occurs only with that repository owner's permission. It leaves room for reviewing code and ensuring changes are satisfactory.

This user guide will focus on how to Fork repositories and implement changes. It will center around macOS systems.

# How to Fork Github Repositories
To fork a repository, first locate a repository to work on through public access or an invititational from the owner. Once on the home page for the project, click the Fork button located in the top-right corner of the browser and near the profile icon.

This will create the copied repository can be edited. To gain access to the code, click on the green **Code** button in approximately the upper-center-right of the page, indicated by the circle.
